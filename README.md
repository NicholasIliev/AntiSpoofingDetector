# Anti-Spoofing Detector

The **AntiSpoofingDetector** is an advanced anti-spoofing/liveness detection system that leverages facial recognition technology. This project is implemented using **Python** and **OpenCV**, providing a robust solution to distinguish between real faces and spoof attempts.

## Features

- **Facial Recognition:** The detector utilizes state-of-the-art facial recognition techniques to identify and authenticate real faces.
  
- **Liveness Detection:** With the help of a trained model, the system assesses the liveness of detected faces to prevent spoofing attempts.

- **Python and OpenCV:** The project is implemented in Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language, and employs the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks.

- **Trained Model:** The AntiSpoofingDetector incorporates a pre-trained model, ensuring accurate and reliable performance in different scenarios.
